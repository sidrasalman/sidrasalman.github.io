Firstly, a feel good anthem was created that spoke directly to the youth about the challenges in their lives and how they must strive to feel good no matter the obstacle at hand. The visual story for the film showcased small stressors in the lives of the TG, situations that were real and relatable, being resolved by a feel good KFC moment. </p><p>OOH was a key touch point, where the norm was challenged by creating visuals that had never been seen before. Since KFC are purveyors of fresh and real, delicious, whole-muscle chicken and it is all about being authentic, the food showcased was as real and authentic a way as possible. Photography was extreme close ups of mouths tearing unapologetically into chicken. The visuals were clutter breaking and created enormous conversation around the brand on social media. </p><p>The next strategy was to pick up a site above a key McDonald\u2019s outlet in Karachi and run the key visual without the KFC logo- a move that was received as being bold and unapologetic with people commenting that even sans-logo the visual was unmistakably KFC. </p><p>Digital was a vital medium for us and we went all out with snackable content like thumbstoppers and slo-mo videos by bloggers devouring KFC\u2019s real chicken.</p><p>The campaign garnered over 120 million impressions across digital platforms, engaging our target audience to connect with the brand in a meaningful way. KFC needed to tap into this dormant subset as a means to increase sales in the short and long term and build brand love which would translate into brand loyalty. Furthermore, the campaign delivered the highest ever sales of KFC Pakistan\u2019s history, delivering a whopping 40% growth over last year\u2019s numbers. </p>","client":"KFC Pakistan","published_at":"June 2021","type":"Equity Campaign","videos":["3D97ka2VjpY"],"images":["kfc-feel-good-godness-in-every-bite-1.jpg","kfc-feel-good-godness-in-every-bite-2.jpg","kfc-feel-good-godness-in-every-bite-3.jpg","kfc-feel-good-godness-in-every-bite-4.jpg","kfc-feel-good-godness-in-every-bite-5.jpg","kfc-feel-good-godness-in-every-bite-6.jpg"]},{"slug":"suzuki-used-car-gala","title":"Suzuki Used Car Gala<br>Brake The Journey: Browse Online, Inspect Offline!","featured_image":"/assets/work/suzuki-pakistan-750x410.jpg","content":"<p>Suzuki Pakistan is the pioneer in automotive brand conducting Used Car Gala since the past 10 years.
